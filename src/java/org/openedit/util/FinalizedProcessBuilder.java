/**
 * This class wraps {@link ProcessBuilder} for creating operating system processes using the safer
 * {@link FinalizedProcess}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Like {@code ProcessBuilder}, each {@code FinalizedProcessBuilder} instance manages a collection of process
 * attributes. The {@link #start()} method creates a new {@link FinalizedProcess} instance with these attributes. The
 * {@link #start()} method can be invoked multiple times from the same instance to create new subprocesses with
 * identical or related attributes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each process builder manages the following attributes, in addition to the attributes from {@link ProcessBuilder}:
 * 
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>a <i>keepProcess</i> indicator, a boolean indicator as to whether the process should be destroyed during cleanup
 * or not. By default the process will be destroyed during cleanup.</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Starting a new process with the default attributes is just as easy as {@link ProcessBuilder}:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {
 * 	&#064;code
 * 	FinalizedProcess process = new ProcessBuilder(&quot;myCommand&quot;, &quot;myArg&quot;).start();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here is an example that redirects standard error to standard output and does not destroy the process when the process
 * is closed:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {
 * 	&#064;code
 * 	FinalizedProcessBuilder pb = new FinalizedProcessBuilder(&quot;myCommand&quot;, &quot;myArg&quot;);
 * 	pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
 * 	pb.keepProcess();
 * 	FinalizedProcess process = pb.start();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *

	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The returned object may be modified using ordinary {@link java.util.Map Map} operations. These modifications will

	 * contain independent process environments, so changes to the returned map will never be reflected in any other
	 * {@code ProcessBuilder} instance or the values returned by {@link System#getenv System.getenv}.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the system does not support environment variables, an empty map is returned.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The returned map does not permit null keys or values. Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or
	 * value will throw a {@link NullPointerException}. Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not

	 * 
	 * <p>

	 * variables or may forbid certain variable names or values. For this reason, attempts to modify the map may fail
	 * with {@link UnsupportedOperationException} or {@link IllegalArgumentException} if the modification is not
	 * permitted by the operating system.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Since the external format of environment variable names and values is system-dependent, there may not be a
	 * one-to-one mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings. Nevertheless, the map is implemented in such a way
	 * that environment variables which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified native representation in
	 * the subprocess.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The returned map and its collection views may not obey the general contract of the {@link Object#equals} and

	 * The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.
